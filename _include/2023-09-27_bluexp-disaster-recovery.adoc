* *Replication plan updates*: 
** *RPO*: You can now enter the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Retention count in the Datastores section of the Replication plan. This indicates the amount of data that must exist that is not older than the set time. If, for example, you set it at 5 minutes, the system can lose up to 5 minutes of data if thereâ€™s a disaster without impacting business critical needs.

Previously, just DHCP was supported. For static IPs, you configure the subnet, gateway, and DNS servers. Additionally, you can now enter credentials for virtual machines.
