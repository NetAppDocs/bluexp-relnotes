=== Support for on-premises installations of BlueXP classification on RHEL version 9

Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 8 and 9 do not support the Docker engine; which was required for the BlueXP classification installation. We now support BlueXP classification installation on RHEL 9.0, 9.1, and 9.2 using Podman version 4 or greater as the container infrastructure. If your environment requires using the newest versions of RHEL, now you can install BlueXP classification (version 1.26 or greater) when using Podman.

At this time we don't supported dark site installations or distributed scanning environments (using a master and remote scanner nodes) when using RHEL 9.x.
