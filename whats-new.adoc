The following changes were introduced with the 3.9.21 release of the Connector.

==== Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.12.0

Cloud Manager can now deploy and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.12.0.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap-relnotes[Learn about the new features included in this release of Cloud Volumes ONTAP^].

==== Digital Wallet enhancements

* The Digital Wallet now shows a summary of the Optimized I/O licensing package and the provisioned WORM capacity for Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems across your account.
+
These details can help you better understand how you're being charged and whether you need to purchase additional capacity.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-manage-capacity-licenses.html[Learn how to view the consumed capacity in your account].

* You can now change from one charging method to the Optimized charging method.
+

==== Optimize cost and performance

You can now optimize the cost and performance of a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system directly from the Canvas.

After you select a working environment, you can choose the *Optimize Cost & Performance* option to change the instance type for Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Choosing a smaller-sized instance can help you reduce costs, while changing to a larger-sized instance can help you optimize performance.

==== AutoSupport notifications

Cloud Manager will now generate a notification if a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system is unable to send AutoSupport messages. The notification includes a link to instructions that you can use to troubleshoot networking issues.

==== Password for new storage VMs

When you create a storage VM on HA pairs in Google Cloud using the API, you can now specify the password for the vsadmin user.
